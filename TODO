# **Sports Betting Recommendation System - Complete Project Specification**

## **Project Overview**
Build a production-ready, end-to-end system that scrapes player statistics and game data from sports websites, stores it in a database, and provides intelligent betting recommendations by analyzing FanDuel odds against historical performance data.

## **Core Requirements**

### **1. Data Scraping Module**

**Sports Coverage:**
- Basketball (NBA)
- Football (NFL)  
- Baseball (MLB)

**Data to Extract:**
- Player statistics (points, rebounds, assists, batting average, etc.)
- Team statistics
- Injury reports
- Game schedules (upcoming games, opponents)
- Historical performance data
- Team strengths/weaknesses analysis
- Head-to-head matchup history

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use Playwright or Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Implement respectful rate limiting (delays between requests)
- Handle dynamic content loading
- Include robust error handling for site changes
- Log all scraping activities
- Implement retry logic for failed requests
- Support multiple data sources per sport for redundancy

**Data Sources (Examples):**
- ESPN.com
- NBA.com, NFL.com, MLB.com
- Basketball-Reference.com
- Pro-Football-Reference.com
- Baseball-Reference.com

### **2. FanDuel Odds Scraper**

**Requirements:**
- Scrape current betting odds and lines
- Extract available bet types (moneyline, spread, over/under, props, parlays)
- Capture live odds updates
- Handle user authentication (login capability)
- Extract available parlay combinations
- Identify boosted odds or promotions

**Technical Considerations:**
- Must handle dynamic JavaScript loading
- Respect rate limits to avoid IP blocking
- Implement session management for logged-in scraping
- Cache odds data with timestamps

### **3. Database Design**

**Technology:** PostgreSQL (or similar relational database)

**Schema Requirements:**

**Players Table:**
- player_id (primary key)
- name
- team
- position
- sport
- active_status

**Player_Stats Table:**
- stat_id (primary key)
- player_id (foreign key)
- game_date
- opponent
- points/yards/hits (sport-specific metrics)
- rebounds/tackles/RBIs
- assists
- minutes_played
- shooting_percentages
- timestamp

**Teams Table:**
- team_id (primary key)
- team_name
- sport
- conference/division
- current_record

**Games Table:**
- game_id (primary key)
- home_team_id
- away_team_id
- game_date
- game_time
- venue
- sport

**Injuries Table:**
- injury_id (primary key)
- player_id
- injury_type
- status (out, questionable, probable)
- updated_date

**Betting_Odds Table:**
- odds_id (primary key)
- game_id
- bet_type
- line
- odds
- source (FanDuel)
- timestamp
- expiration

**Recommendations Table:**
- recommendation_id (primary key)
- game_id
- bet_type
- recommended_pick
- confidence_score
- reasoning
- timestamp

### **4. Data Processing & API Layer**

**Requirements:**
- RESTful API to serve data
- Endpoints for:
  - Get player stats by player/team/date range
  - Get upcoming games
  - Get injury reports
  - Get current odds
  - Get recommendations
- Data validation and cleaning
- Normalization of scraped data
- Handle missing or inconsistent data

**API Endpoints (Examples):**
```
GET /api/players/{sport}
GET /api/players/{player_id}/stats
GET /api/games/upcoming
GET /api/injuries/current
GET /api/odds/{game_id}
GET /api/recommendations/{sport}
POST /api/analyze-bet
```

### **5. Recommendation Engine**

**Analysis Logic:**
- Compare player recent performance (last 5-10 games) against historical averages
- Factor in opponent defensive/offensive rankings
- Consider home/away splits
- Account for injury reports
- Analyze head-to-head matchup history
- Calculate value bets (where odds don't match probability)
- Identify correlated parlay opportunities

**Output:**
- Ranked list of recommended bets
- Confidence score (1-10 or percentage)
- Detailed reasoning for each pick
- Risk assessment
- Suggested parlay combinations
- Expected value calculations

**Recommendation Criteria:**
- Statistical edge threshold (minimum advantage)
- Recent form weighting
- Injury impact assessment
- Matchup favorability scoring

### **6. Scheduler & Automation**

**Requirements:**
- Cron jobs or task scheduler (Celery, APScheduler)
- Daily scraping schedule:
  - Player stats: After games complete
  - Injury reports: Multiple times daily
  - Game schedules: Weekly
  - Odds: Every 1-4 hours (configurable)
- Database backup automation
- Data freshness monitoring
- Alert system for scraper failures

### **7. User Interface (Optional but Recommended)**

**Web Dashboard:**
- Login page
- Display upcoming games with recommendations
- Show player stats and trends
- Visualize confidence scores
- Parlay builder interface
- Historical performance tracking
- Settings for notification preferences

**Technology Stack Options:**
- Frontend: React, Vue.js, or simple HTML/JS
- Backend: Flask, FastAPI, or Django
- Styling: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap

### **8. Error Handling & Monitoring**

**Requirements:**
- Comprehensive logging (all scraping, API calls, errors)
- Email/SMS alerts for critical failures
- Graceful degradation when data sources unavailable
- Data validation checks
- Automated health checks
- Performance monitoring

**Error Scenarios to Handle:**
- Website structure changes
- Network timeouts
- Rate limiting/IP blocking
- Missing data fields
- Database connection failures
- Authentication failures

### **9. Security & Compliance**

**Requirements:**
- Secure credential storage (environment variables, secrets manager)
- HTTPS for all API communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- User authentication (if multi-user)
- Comply with website terms of service
- No automated bet placement (manual execution only)

### **10. Deployment & Infrastructure**

**Production Requirements:**
- Containerization (Docker)
- Deployment platform (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, or Heroku)
- Database hosting with backups
- Environment configuration (dev, staging, prod)
- CI/CD pipeline (optional but recommended)
- Scalability considerations

**Recommended Stack:**
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis (for caching)
- Nginx (reverse proxy)
- Docker & Docker Compose
