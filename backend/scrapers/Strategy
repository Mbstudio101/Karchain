Example:
 Determining whether a player will go over or under on NBA points, assists, or rebounds requires a combination of analyzing recent performance trends, matchup data, and situational context. Successful strategies often involve looking at player usage, team pace, injury reports, and defensive efficiency against specific positions. 
Here is a breakdown of how to analyze each factor:
1. Analyze Player Usage and Role
Usage Rate: High-usage players (e.g., superstars who handle the ball often) have more opportunities to exceed their lines.
Minutes Trend: Monitor recent minutes played rather than season averages. A player trending upward in minutes is more likely to hit their over.
Injury Impact: When a starter is injured, backup players often see an increase in minutes and usage, making their "over" a strong bet. 
2. Evaluate Matchups (Defense vs. Position)
Defensive Weakness: Look for teams that allow high stats to specific positions (e.g., a team that allows the most assists to point guards).
Defensive Personnel: A player matching up against a elite defender might go under, while a player facing a weak defender is a candidate for an over.
Rebounding Mismatches: Centers facing undersized frontcourts or weak rebounding teams are good targets for "over" rebounding props. 
3. Consider Game Context and Pace
Game Pace: Fast-paced games (high possessions per game) create more opportunities for all stats. Target overs in high-total games.
Spread and Over/Under: A tight spread suggests a competitive game, meaning stars will play high minutes. A large blowout potential might lead to star players sitting out the fourth quarter, leading to an "under".
Back-to-Backs: Teams playing on the second night of a back-to-back are often fatigued, which can lead to lower performance (unders) for guards. 
4. Review Recent Performance Trends
Last 5-10 Games: Analyze the last 5-10 games rather than full-season stats to identify current streaks or slumps.
Home/Road Splits: Some players perform significantly better at home, while others struggle on the road. 
5. Line Shopping and Tools
Compare Sportsbooks: Different sportsbooks offer different lines. One book might have a player at 24.5 points, while another has 26.5. Always find the best value.
Use Data Tools: Utilize apps like Props.cash, StatMuse, or Rithmm to quickly analyze hit rates for specific props. 
Summary of Prop Strategies
Prop Type 	Key Focus Area
Points	Usage rate, opposing team's defensive rating, recent scoring form
Assists	Total points in game, teammate shooting efficiency, matchups vs. defenses that collapse on drives
Rebounds	Team pace, opponent's missed shot rate, frontcourt height
Combo (PRA)	High-usage players in fast-paced games
